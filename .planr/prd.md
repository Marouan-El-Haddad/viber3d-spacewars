### 1.2 Product Summary

Space Striker is a 3D space shooter game featuring free-roaming gameplay in a three-dimensional space environment. Players control a spacecraft from a third-person perspective using WASD controls for movement and spacebar for speed boost, navigating through asteroid fields while engaging in combat with enemy ships. The game features an inertial movement system, laser weapons, and a points-based scoring system. Players aim to achieve high scores by destroying enemy ships while avoiding hazards like asteroids.
