# User Story: US-007 - Ship Strafing - Right

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to strafe my ship right with the D key so that I can avoid obstacles or position for attacks.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Pressing D key causes the ship to move laterally to the right
- [ ] Ship maintains forward orientation while strafing
- [ ] Movement follows inertial physics rules
- [ ] Visual effects indicate lateral thrust
- [ ] Strafing can be combined with forward/backward movement

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement right strafing in ship control system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Extend lateral movement mechanics for right direction - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add right thruster visual effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement right thruster sound effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Test combined movement inputs - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 1 story point

## Developer Notes:

- Mirror the left strafing implementation from US-006
- Ensure balanced movement parameters between left and right
- Reuse thruster effect system with proper positioning
- Consider implementing a visual indicator for combined movement
