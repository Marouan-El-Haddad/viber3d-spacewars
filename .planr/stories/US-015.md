# User Story: US-015 - Laser Interaction with Asteroids

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to destroy or damage asteroids with my laser weapons so that I can clear paths through asteroid fields.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Laser projectiles register collision with asteroids
- [ ] Visual effects show asteroid damage or destruction
- [ ] Audio effects accompany hits and destruction
- [ ] Large asteroids may split into smaller fragments when hit
- [ ] Destroyed asteroids award points

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement laser-asteroid collision detection - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create asteroid health/damage system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add asteroid destruction mechanics - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement asteroid fragmentation system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add hit visual effects for asteroids - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement hit audio effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Integrate with scoring system - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 3 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Consider different asteroid types with varying resistance to laser damage
- Implement physics for asteroid fragments after destruction
- Create particle effects for asteroid damage and destruction
- Balance scoring for asteroid destruction based on size and difficulty
