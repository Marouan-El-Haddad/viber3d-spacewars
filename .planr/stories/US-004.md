# User Story: US-004 - Directional Controls

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want complete directional control over my ship using WASD keys to navigate in all directions through space.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] W key moves ship forward with appropriate acceleration
- [ ] S key moves ship backward or decelerates forward motion
- [ ] A key strafes ship left while maintaining forward orientation
- [ ] D key strafes ship right while maintaining forward orientation
- [ ] Directional movements can be combined (e.g., forward+left)
- [ ] Visual effects indicate thrust direction for each movement type
- [ ] Audio effects match movement direction and intensity
- [ ] All movements follow the inertial physics system

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement forward movement with W key - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement backward movement with S key - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement left strafing with A key - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement right strafing with D key - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create directional thrust visual effects for all directions - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement engine sound system with directional variations - Status: TODO
- [ ] Develop combined movement mechanics for multi-key inputs - Status: TODO
- [ ] Fine-tune acceleration and deceleration parameters - Status: TODO
- [ ] Test all movement combinations for smooth transitions - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 5 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Build upon the ship movement system from US-003
- Ensure proper vector calculations for combined movement directions
- Use Three.js particle systems for directional thruster effects
- Implement spatial audio for engine sounds that vary by direction
- Balance acceleration rates between different directions for consistent feel
- Test edge cases like rapid direction changes and diagonal movements
- Consider subtle camera effects during movement to enhance immersion
