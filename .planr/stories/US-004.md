# User Story: US-004 - Forward Movement

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to move my ship forward with the W key so that I can advance through the game space.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Pressing W key causes the ship to move forward
- [ ] Ship accelerates gradually when key is held
- [ ] Movement follows inertial physics rules
- [ ] Visual effects indicate forward thrust
- [ ] Engine sound effects scale with acceleration

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement forward movement in ship control system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create acceleration model for gradual speed increase - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add forward thrust visual effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement engine sound system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Fine-tune inertial movement parameters - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 2 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Build upon the basic movement system from US-003
- Use Three.js particle systems for thruster effects
- Implement spatial audio for engine sounds
- Ensure that acceleration feels satisfying but not too slow
