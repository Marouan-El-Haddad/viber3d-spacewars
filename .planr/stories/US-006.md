# User Story: US-006 - Ship Strafing - Left

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to strafe my ship left with the A key so that I can avoid obstacles or position for attacks.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Pressing A key causes the ship to move laterally to the left
- [ ] Ship maintains forward orientation while strafing
- [ ] Movement follows inertial physics rules
- [ ] Visual effects indicate lateral thrust
- [ ] Strafing can be combined with forward/backward movement

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement left strafing in ship control system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create lateral movement mechanics - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add left thruster visual effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement lateral thruster sound effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Integrate with existing forward/backward movement - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 2 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Build upon the existing movement system
- Ensure proper vector calculations for combined movement directions
- Add side thruster particle effects
- Test multi-key inputs for smooth combined movement
