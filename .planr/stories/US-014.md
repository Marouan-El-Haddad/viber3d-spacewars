# User Story: US-014 - Ship Collision with Asteroids

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want my ship to take damage when colliding with asteroids so that there's a penalty for poor navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Collision detection functions correctly between ship and asteroids
- [ ] Visual effects show collision impact
- [ ] Audio effects accompany collision
- [ ] Player health decreases upon collision
- [ ] Ship shows damage effects relative to health level
- [ ] Physics of collision are realistic (rebound, deflection)

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement ship-asteroid collision detection - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create ship damage system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add ship health reduction mechanics - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement collision visual effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add collision audio effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create physics-based collision response - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement visual damage indicators on ship - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 3 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Consider different damage amounts based on asteroid size and velocity
- Create damage visual effects that scale with impact severity
- Implement a grace period after collision to prevent rapid multiple hits
- Design progressive visual damage on the player's ship as health decreases
