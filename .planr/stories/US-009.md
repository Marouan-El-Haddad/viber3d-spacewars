# User Story: US-009 - Mouse-Controlled Aiming

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to aim using my mouse so that I can target enemies or objects precisely.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Mouse movement controls targeting reticle
- [ ] Ship orientation partially follows targeting direction
- [ ] Aiming is responsive and accurate
- [ ] Visual indicator shows current aim point
- [ ] Target lock indicator appears when aiming at valid targets

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement mouse input tracking system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create targeting reticle component - Status: TODO
- [ ] Develop ship orientation logic - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add visual indicators for targeting - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement target detection and lock system - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 3 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Use ECS for handling input and targeting state
- Consider screen-space vs world-space for targeting system
- Make aiming feel responsive while still maintaining inertial ship movement
- Design clear visual feedback for successful targeting
