# User Story: US-003 - Basic Ship Movement

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to control my spacecraft's movement in a 3D environment using WASD keys so that I can navigate freely through space.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Ship moves in response to WASD key inputs
- [ ] Movement maintains inertial physics (continues in direction when controls are released)
- [ ] Ship's orientation changes appropriately during movement
- [ ] Movement is smooth and responsive
- [ ] Control scheme follows standard WASD conventions

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement ship movement traits - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create ship physics system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement input handling system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add visual feedback for movement - Status: TODO
- [ ] Design and implement ship orientation system - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 4 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Use Koota ECS traits for position, velocity, and inputs
- Implement inertial physics for realistic space movement
- Ensure responsive controls with appropriate sensitivity
- Consider implementing ship thruster visual effects
