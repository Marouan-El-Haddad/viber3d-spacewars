# User Story: US-003 - Ship Movement System

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to control my spacecraft with realistic inertial physics so that movement feels authentic and engaging.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Ship responds to WASD inputs for directional movement
- [ ] Momentum is preserved when controls are released (inertial physics)
- [ ] Ship continues moving in a direction after input is released
- [ ] Gradual deceleration occurs without input
- [ ] Ship's orientation changes appropriately during movement
- [ ] Movement is smooth and responsive

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement core physics system for ship movement - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create momentum preservation mechanics - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement input handling system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add visual feedback for movement (thruster effects) - Status: TODO
- [ ] Design ship orientation system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Fine-tune physics parameters for enjoyable gameplay - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 5 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Use Koota ECS traits for position, velocity, and inputs
- Design physics system as a foundation for all movement-related features
- Ensure appropriate balance between realistic physics and enjoyable controls
- Consider implementing subtle auto-stabilization that can be toggled
- Test with different movement combinations to ensure predictable behavior
