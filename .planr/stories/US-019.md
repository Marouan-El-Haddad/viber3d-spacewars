# User Story: US-019 - Inertial Ship Movement

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want my ship to follow realistic inertial physics so that movement feels authentic in space.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Ship continues moving in a direction after input is released
- [ ] Momentum is preserved during direction changes
- [ ] Deceleration occurs gradually without input
- [ ] Different ship masses (if applicable) affect inertia differently
- [ ] Boosting affects momentum appropriately

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Design and implement inertial physics system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create momentum preservation mechanics - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement gradual deceleration system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add mass properties affecting inertia - Status: TODO
- [ ] Integrate with boost mechanics - Status: TODO
- [ ] Fine-tune overall physics feel - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 4 story points

## Developer Notes:

- This is a core system that many other mechanics will build upon
- Balance realism with enjoyable gameplay - too much inertia can feel unresponsive
- Consider implementing a subtle auto-stabilization feature that can be toggled
- Test extensively with different input combinations to ensure predictable behavior
