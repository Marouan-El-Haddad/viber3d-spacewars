# User Story: US-010 - Weapon System

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to fire laser weapons that follow consistent physics so that I can attack enemies with predictable and skill-based targeting.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Left mouse button fires laser from ship
- [ ] Laser projectiles follow correct trajectory physics
- [ ] Lasers travel at consistent velocity
- [ ] Laser projectiles have limited range or lifespan
- [ ] Visual effects show laser firing
- [ ] Audio effects accompany laser firing
- [ ] Cooldown mechanic prevents continuous firing

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement weapon firing system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create projectile physics system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement projectile lifespan/range limits - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add projectile cleanup system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create projectile velocity and trajectory mechanics - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add laser visual effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement weapon sound effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Design and implement firing cooldown system - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 5 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Use object pooling for projectiles to improve performance
- Ensure projectile collisions are consistently detected
- Design projectile behavior to feel satisfying while maintaining performance
- Fine-tune projectile speed to balance challenge and player satisfaction
- Implement a heat or cooldown system to prevent spamming
