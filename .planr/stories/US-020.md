# User Story: US-020 - Projectile Physics

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want laser projectiles to follow consistent physics rules so that targeting feels predictable and skill-based.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Lasers travel at consistent velocity
- [ ] Laser trajectory remains constant unless affected by designated factors
- [ ] Laser projectiles have limited range or lifespan
- [ ] Projectile physics is consistent across all game scenarios
- [ ] Multiple projectiles behave independently according to the same rules

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement projectile movement system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create projectile lifespan/range limits - Status: TODO
- [ ] Develop velocity and trajectory mechanics - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add projectile spawning system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement projectile cleanup system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Integrate with weapon firing system - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 3 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Consider implementing an object pooling system for projectiles
- Design projectile behavior to feel satisfying while maintaining performance
- Fine-tune projectile speed to balance challenge and player satisfaction
- Ensure visual effects align perfectly with actual projectile collision areas
