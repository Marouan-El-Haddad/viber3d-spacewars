# User Story: US-013 - Asteroid Field Navigation

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to navigate through asteroid fields so that I can test my piloting skills while avoiding damage.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Asteroids appear in the game environment
- [ ] Asteroids have varied sizes and appearances
- [ ] Asteroids rotate and drift according to physics patterns
- [ ] Collisions with asteroids are detected and have consequences
- [ ] Asteroids can be destroyed with laser fire

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Create asteroid entity system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement asteroid generation and placement - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add asteroid physics (rotation, drift) - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement asteroid collision detection - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create asteroid field generation algorithm - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add asteroid destruction mechanics - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 4 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Use instanced rendering for asteroid performance
- Implement a procedural generation system for asteroids
- Create varied asteroid models/sizes for visual interest
- Consider using LOD (Level of Detail) for distant asteroids
