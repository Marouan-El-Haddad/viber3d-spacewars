# User Story: US-005 - Backward Movement

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want to move my ship backward with the S key so that I can retreat or maneuver in reverse.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Pressing S key causes the ship to move backward
- [ ] Ship decelerates forward movement when key is pressed during forward motion
- [ ] Movement follows inertial physics rules
- [ ] Visual effects indicate reverse thrust
- [ ] Engine sound effects indicate reverse movement

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement backward movement in ship control system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create deceleration model for controlling momentum - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add reverse thrust visual effects - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement reverse engine sound - Status: TODO
- [ ] Fine-tune backward movement parameters - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 2 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Extend the forward movement system from US-004
- Create unique visual effects for reverse thrusters
- Ensure that deceleration feels responsive but realistic
- Consider implementing a slight camera effect during rapid direction changes
