# User Story: US-012 - Enemy Ship Behavior

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want enemy ships to move and attack according to defined patterns so that I have challenging opponents.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Enemy ships move according to predefined behavior patterns
- [ ] Enemy ships target and attack the player
- [ ] Enemy attacks can be avoided with skilled movement
- [ ] Different enemy types exhibit distinct behaviors
- [ ] Enemy behavior follows physics rules for movement and momentum

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement enemy ship behavior system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create enemy targeting logic - Status: TODO
- [ ] Design and implement attack patterns - Status: TODO
- [ ] Develop multiple enemy ship types - Status: TODO
- [ ] Integrate enemy physics with movement patterns - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add enemy weapon systems - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 5 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Use ECS for behavior implementation
- Design behavior patterns that are challenging but fair
- Create distinct visual identities for different enemy types
- Implement an AI difficulty scaling system to keep the game engaging
