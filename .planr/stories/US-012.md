# User Story: US-012 - Enemy Ship Behavior

## Status: TODO

## Description:

As a player, I want enemy ships to move and attack with basic patterns so that I have challenging opponents.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Enemy ships move according to simple behavior patterns
- [ ] Enemy ships target and attack the player
- [ ] Enemy attacks can be avoided with skilled movement
- [ ] Enemy behavior follows physics rules for movement and momentum

## General Tasks:

- [ ] All requirements from the plan are implemented
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Code has been reviewed

## Sub Tasks:

- [ ] Implement basic enemy ship behavior system - Status: TODO
- [ ] Create simple targeting logic - Status: TODO
- [ ] Design and implement basic attack patterns - Status: TODO
- [ ] Integrate enemy physics with movement patterns - Status: TODO
- [ ] Add enemy weapon systems - Status: TODO
- [ ] Implement enemy spawning system - Status: TODO

## Estimation: 4 story points

## Developer Notes:

- Keep enemy AI simple but challenging
- Focus on a single, well-designed enemy type initially
- Use ECS for behavior implementation
- Ensure enemies respect the same physics rules as the player
- Balance enemy difficulty to be challenging but fair
